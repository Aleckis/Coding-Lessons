        <p>
          JavaScript is a versatile and widely used programming language,
          primarily in web development. Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, it has
          evolved from a simple tool for adding interactivity to web pages into
          a robust language capable of creating complete applications, both on
          the front-end and back-end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its popularity is due to its flexibility, ease of learning, and
          universal support in modern browsers.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Basic_Syntax_and_Data_Types">
        <header>Basic Syntax and Data Types</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript's syntax is designed to be accessible to beginner
          programmers, yet powerful enough for experienced developers. The
          language uses dynamic data types, meaning variables can store
          different types of values over time. Basic types include numbers,
          strings, booleans, null, and undefined. JavaScript also offers
          familiar control structures such as if/else, switch, and loops,
          allowing developers to create complex logic intuitively.
        </p>
        <p>Some types of data in JavaScript are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>String</li>
          <li>Number</li>
          <li>Boolena</li>
          <li>Undefined</li>
          <li>Null</li>
        </ul>
        <code
          >// Numbers: <br />
          let length = 16; <br />
          let weight = 7.5; <br /><br />
          // Strings: <br />
          let color = "Yellow"; <br />
          let lastName = "Johnson"; <br /><br />
          // Booleans <br />
          let x = true; <br />
          let y = false;
        </code>
        <p>
          The code example above shows the declaration of some variables of the
          following types: number, string and boolean.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Functions_and_Scope">
        <header>Functions and Scope</header>
        <p>
          Functions are fundamental building blocks in JavaScript, allowing for
          code organization and reuse. They can be declared in various ways,
          including named functions, function expressions, and more recently,
          arrow functions.
        </p>
        <code
          >// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2 <br />
          function myFunction(p1, p2) { <br />
          return p1 * p2; <br />
          }</code
        >
        <p>
          Scope in JavaScript determines the visibility and accessibility of
          variables, with important concepts such as global, local, and block
          scope. Understanding scope is crucial for avoiding bugs and creating
          more efficient and organized code.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Objects_and_Arrays">
        <header>Objects and Arrays</header>
        <p>
          Objects and arrays are essential data structures in JavaScript.
          Objects allow grouping related data and functionalities, while arrays
          are used to store ordered lists of elements.
        </p>
        <code
          >//JavaScript object <br />
          const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"}; <br /><br />
          //Javascript arrays <br />
          const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];</code
        >
        <p>
          JavaScript offers a variety of methods to manipulate these structures,
          such as map, filter, and reduce for arrays, which facilitate complex
          data operations.
        </p>
        <code
          >const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; <br />
          const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2); <br />
          console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="DOM_and_Browser_Manipulation">
        <header>DOM and Browser Manipulation</header>
        <p>
          The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML
          and XML documents. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically
          modify the content, structure, and style of web pages. This includes
          the ability to select elements, change their content, add or remove
          elements, and respond to user events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, JavaScript can interact with browser APIs for
          functionalities such as local storage, geolocation, and much more.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Asynchronous_Programming">
        <header>Asynchronous Programming</header>
        <p>
          Asynchronous programming is a crucial concept in JavaScript,
          especially for operations that may take time, such as network
          requests. JavaScript offers several ways to handle asynchronous
          operations, from traditional callbacks to Promises and the more recent
          async/await pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          These tools allow developers to write code that efficiently handles
          long-running operations without blocking program execution.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="ES6+_and_Modern_Features">
        <header>ES6+ and Modern Features</header>
        <p>
          ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and subsequent versions brought significant
          improvements to JavaScript. This includes new ways of declaring
          variables (let and const), more concise syntax for functions (arrow
          functions), better string handling (template literals), and new data
          types like Set and Map.
        </p>
        <code
          >// Arrow function and template literal<br />
          const greet = name => `Hello, ${name}!`;<br />
          <br />
          // Destructuring and default parameter<br />
          const displayInfo = ({ name = 'Guest', age = 'Unknown' } = {}) => {<br />
          console.log(`Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`);<br />
          };<br />
          <br />
          // Usage<br />
          console.log(greet('Alice')); // Output: Hello, Alice!<br />
          displayInfo({ name: 'Bob', age: 30 }); // Output: Name: Bob, Age:
          30<br />
          displayInfo(); // Output: Name: Guest, Age: Unknown<br
        /></code>
        <p>
          Additionally, the introduction of native modules and classes
          significantly improved code organization and reuse in JavaScript
          projects.

        <p>
          The JavaScript ecosystem is vast and constantly evolving. Node.js
          expanded the use of JavaScript to the server-side, while npm became
          the world's largest software package repository. Build tools like
          Webpack and Rollup help optimize code for production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frameworks such as React, Vue, and Angular dominate front-end
          development, while testing libraries like Jest ensure code quality.
          This rich ecosystem allows developers to create complex and scalable
          applications using JavaScript.
